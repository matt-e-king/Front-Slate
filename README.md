Front-Slate
===========

Front end workflow bringing Bootstrap 3, AngularJS, Font Awesome and Mustache all together under one roof for some serious local development. This front end development environment comes with all the tools necessary to build a Bootstrap ready website, using the scalability of Grunt, LESS and Mustache.

Was originally built to develop, test and output static HTML pages using JSON -> Mustache, while at the same time creating resusable Mustache pages and partials that could be past to the backend (e.g. .NET creating C# objects and passing to "N"ustache, resuing same pages and partials) 

This environment can best be explain by walking through the different functions and functionality of the Gruntfile.js.
